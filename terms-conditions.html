                        <p>The use of Radio Space Services is subject to the terms of the agreement between the User and Radio Space.

                            The agreement between the User and Radio Space consists of the Terms and Conditions set out in this document and the Privacy Policy applied by Radio Space: (https://www.radiospace.app/privacy.html).

                            The Terms and Conditions constitute a legally binding agreement between the User and Radio Space regarding the use of Radio Space Services. The User should carefully read and get acquainted with them.

                            The Terms and Conditions apply to all Users of Radio Space Services.

                            This agreement is concluded for an indefinite period.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="text-container">
                        <h3>Acceptance of Terms and Conditions</h3>
                        <p>The User needs to accept these Terms and Conditions in order to use Radio Space Services.

                            Failure to accept this Terms and Conditions results in the User not being able to use Radio Space Services.

                            The User acknowledges that the moment they begin to use Radio Space Services should be treated as the acceptance of the Terms and Conditions.

                            The User may not use Radio Space Services if they are of an age that prevents them from concluding a legally
                            binding agreement with Radio Space.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="text-container">
                        <h3>Subject of the service</h3>
                        <p>The provision of Radio Space Services consists of providing the User with a search engine and a directory of Internet radio stations with URL addresses for audio streams made available to the public by radio broadcasters.

                            Playback of radio programs is done through a built-in player or an internal Internet browser, which entails a direct access to the radio station's website.

                            Radio Space allows its Users to connect directly with broadcasters. Playback of the audio stream and radio stations is done through connecting the User’s device directly to the radio station's streaming server.

                            Radio Space is not a broadcaster and does not participate in audio transmission. It does not retransmit and does not interfere with the content distributed by broadcasters.

                            Radio Space does not guarantee all radio stations to be present in the directory, and in particular, it does not guarantee the possibility of listening to all radio programs.

                            Radio Space shares only the links to public and unsecured audio streams.

                            Radio Space plays only publicly available audio streams. It does not violate any security measures that may be used by broadcasters to prevent playback on external players.

                            The URLs of the audio streams available in Radio Space come, among others, from publicly available radio stations’ websites.

                            The URLs of the audio streams are acquired, among others, with the use of automatic mechanisms, called bots, that analyze content only from the publicly available broadcasters’ websites.

                            Every broadcaster may block access to their content for Radio Space mechanisms by making appropriate configuration entries on their websites. Such configuration entries will be unambiguously interpreted as the lack of permission to share addresses to audio streams with Radio Space.

                            Radio Space respects the right of radio broadcasters to request the removal of the URL to the station's audio stream from Radio Space's directory. The removal of the station takes place on explicit request submitted via email: ednadev001@gmail.com.
